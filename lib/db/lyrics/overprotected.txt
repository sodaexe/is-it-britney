I need time (time), love, joy (joy)
I need space, love
I need me (action!)
Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in takin' chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected
I tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told, I can't believe
What I hear about the world, I realize I'm overprotected
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in takin' chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel (help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected
I need time, love
I need space (this is it)
I don't need nobody tellin' me just what I wanna
What I want, want, what I'm gonna
(I need) do about my destiny (I say no, no)
Nobody's tellin' me just what I wanna (do, do)
I'm so fed up with people tellin' me to be
Someone else but me (action!)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected
I don't need nobody tellin' me just what I wanna
What I want, want, what I'm gonna
Do about my destiny (I say no, no)
Nobody's tellin' me just what I wanna (do, do)
I'm so fed up with people tellin' me to be
Someone else but me
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
(Oh I can't) I can't help the way I feel (help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected
