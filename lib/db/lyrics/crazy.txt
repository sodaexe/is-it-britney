Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something
What can I do?
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping, it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa oh oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Oh, oh
Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wasting my feelings on you
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa oh oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every day and every night
You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa oh oh, crazy (you make me feel alright)
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night (oh, oh)
You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
Yeah eh eh yeah
Whoa oh oh, crazy, but it feels alright (you drive me crazy, baby)
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
