Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because

My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you (Oh yeah)
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be

Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby (Oh)
Oh, baby, baby (Yeah, yeah)

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my loneliness is killin' me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign?
