It's Britney, bitch
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you (you)
Public display of affection (ah-ah-ah)
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rockin' (we keep on rockin'), we keep on rockin' (we keep on rockin')
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watchin' (and they keep watchin'), keep watchin'
Feels like the crowd is saying
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
A center of attention (do you feel that?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position (yeah)
If you're on a mission (uh-huh), you got my permission, oh (oh)
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rockin' (we keep on rockin'), we keep on rockin' (oh, uh-huh)
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watchin' (they keep watchin'), keep watchin'
(Feels like the crowd is sayin')
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
I just can't control myself
Ooh (more)
They want more? Well, I'll give them more
Ow! (More)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme more (gimme more)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme more (ooh-ooh!)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme, gimme (more), gimme (more), gimme, gimme (more)
Gimme more, yeah
Oh, gimme more, gimme more
(More, more, m-m-m-m-m-more)
Gimme more, gimme more, babe (Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja)
I just want more
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme (Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I bet you didn't see this one comin'
The Incredible Lago (more, more, m-m-m-m-m-m-)
The legendary Miss Britney Spears
And the unstoppable Danja
Ah, you're gonna have to remove me
'Cause I ain't going nowhere (more, more, m-m-m-m-m-m-more)
